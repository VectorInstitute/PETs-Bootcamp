## TensorFlow Privacy

This folder contains three applications of TFP using:
- Logistic regression on the heart disease dataset (contains grid search to explore privacy vs. utility tradeoff)
- Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) on the heart disease dataset (contains an adversarial example and grid search to explore privacy vs. utility tradeoff)
- DP-SGD on the credit card fraud detection dataset (used oversampling to deal with imbalanced classification; contains an adversarial example and grid search to explore privacy vs. utility tradeoff)
