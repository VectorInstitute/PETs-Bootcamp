Almost didn't check me out because of it. I'm wearing a fricken blazer and shorts. An outfit I'd wear to my corporate job. Also, the last time I was there, she told me I looked chubby in my ID (Im 105lbs) and almost didn't sell me a pack of smokes. I'm 22. Her attitude was foul and completely inappropriate. She wouldn't give me her name but I sure as hell plan on finding out. To the owner, please respond to this and I will be happy to give you my information. I also will be contacting the corporate office. I would negative stars if I could.\">"
