# Federated Learning With Tabular Data

This notebook provides an example of horizontal federated learning using multi-layer perceptrons and tabular data.

## Data
The data in this demo is sourced from the the [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

## Dependencies
This demo relies primarily on [TensorFlow Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated).

## Running on Vector Cluster
During the bootcamp, conda environments will be preloaded with dependencies for multiple PETs. The example data file ```breast_cancer_data.csv``` is located in ```/ssd003/projects/pets/datasets/```
