    "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables **arithmetic computations to be performed on encrypted data**. Ideally, computations over encrypted data should correspond exactly to their unencrypted counterparts. The following diagram illustrates this concept over the addition of two numbers. \n",

    "In general, **HE does not support all arithmetic computations**. Popular HE packages like [Microsoft's SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) implement limited arithmetic operations, namely **addition and multiplication** over integer and floating point values, from an algebraic point of view. \n",

    "In this series of notebooks, we will explore [OpenMined's TenSEAL](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL), a Python package for vector and tensor computations that extends SEAL.\n",

    "The following data types are used for arithmetic computations in TenSEAL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BFVVector** - for 1D integer arrays.\n",
    "- **CKKSVector** - for 1D float arrays.\n",

    "## 2.1 Theory: CKKS scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS)** is a scheme for Leveled Homomorphic Encryption that supports approximate arithmetics over complex numbers (hence, real numbers).\n",
    " \n",
    "A high-level overview of the CKKS scheme is presented in the following diagram:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.2 CKKS Encryption Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter 1: The scaling factor (global_scale)\n",
    "The first step of the CKKS encryption scheme is to encode a vector of real numbers into a plaintext polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scaling factor** defines the encoding precision for the binary representation of numbers. Intuitively, we are talking about binary precision as pictured below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"attachment:61553f50-9aa4-456a-a921-38e14aa99c4f.png\" alt=\"ckks-high-level\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter 2: The polynomial modulus degree (poly_modulus_degree)\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomial modulus($N$ in the diagram) directly affects:\n",
    " - The number of coefficients in plaintext polynomials\n",
    " - The size of ciphertext elements\n",
    " - The computational performance of the scheme (bigger is worse)\n",
    " - The security level (bigger is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "In TenSEAL, as in Microsoft SEAL, **the degree of the polynomial modulus must be a power of 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter 3: The coefficient modulus sizes (coeff_mod_bit_sizes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The last parameter required for the scheme is a list of binary sizes.\n",
    "Using this list, SEAL will generate a list of primes of those binary sizes, called the coefficient modulus($q$ in the diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient modulus directly affects:\n",
    " - The size of ciphertext elements\n",
    " - **The length of the list indicates the level of the scheme (or the number of encrypted multiplications supported)**.\n",
    " - The security level (bigger is worse).\n",
    " \n",
    "In TenSEAL, as in Microsoft SEAL, each of the prime numbers in the **coefficient modulus must be at most 60 bits and must be congruent to 1 modulo 2*poly_modulus_degree**.\n",
